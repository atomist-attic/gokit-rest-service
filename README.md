#### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites to running this generator.

#### Parameters

To run this generator you must supply the following parameters.

Name | Required | Default | Description
-----|----------|---------|------------
`project_name` | Yes | |  A valid GitHub repository name.  It must be 21 characters or less to avoid truncating name when the its Slack channel is created.
`org_name` | Yes | | A valid GitHub organisation name.
`service_name` | Yes | |  A name for your new Goo kit service.
`service_contract_name` | Yes | | The name of your new project's service's contract.
`description` | No | My new Go kit service project | A brief description of the project.

#### Running

Run it as follows:

```
$ cd parent/directory
$ rug generate atomist-rugs:gokit-rest-service:NewGoKitRestService \
    pet-shop-service \
    org_name=myorg \
    service_name=mymicroservice \
    service_contract_name=mymicroservicecontract \
    description="Go kit service for selling stuff"
```

Note the first parameter, the `project_name`, is different in that you
do not need to supply the name of the parameter, just the value.  This
is because the `project_name` parameter is required for all
generators.  This will create a directory named `pet-shop-service` and
populate it with a working Go kit REST service.  If you are happy
with the change, commit the changes.

```
$ cd pet-shop-service
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Initial version generated by Atomist'
```
